    <h2>Okay, but how does it all work?</h2>
    <p>Let's say you just had a long and exhausting day of work and you want nothing more than to sit down and play a game of Krunker. You turn on your computer and go to Krunker dot com. Your computer sends requests to a server &#8594; server then receives the requests &#8594; server sends files to browser &#8594; Time to KRUNK! But what the hell is a server?!!!</p>

    <p>A server is just another computer somewhere in the world. Could be in a data center, hosted by some company like Google or Microsoft, or it could even be your own computer! This is called a local host. It's useful when you want to look at your apps during development stages. That way nobody can see your work in progress. It usually gets messy and that would be so embarrasing if somebody saw that... It's a protected place that only you can enter and the best part is you don't even need internet! We will be working on a local server in the beginning.</p>

    <p>Now let's talk about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).</p>
